xfce4-mount-plugin - version 1.0.0

This little plugin behaves like the "kwikdisk - removable media utility" 
shipped with KDE.

Press it and it will display a list of items representing your various devices. 
If you click on an unmounted devices it will mount it and vice versa. There is 
a warning in case a device can't be mounted or when unmounting fails.

The plugin displays various information on each device:
"device name" > "mount point" ["used size"/"total size"] "available size" free 
and an obvious progress bar.

The plugin works in a very simple way. It builds a list of devices from your 
/etc/fstab (using setfsent() and getfsent() ) and gets device stats from the 
list of mounted devices (i.e. same data as the 'df' command), using setmntent()
and getmntent(). On *BSD systems it uses getmntinfo().
For mouting a device, the plugin simply runs a "mount /mount_point/ " command 
if no other command is explicitly specified in the options dialog.
