Listen to HAL/Udev for new devices. Code is already in places-plugin, in xfdesktop and in Thunar, so shouldn't be a big deal.

Use fusermount -u for FUSE file systems.

Have a look at the icon stuff: when changing from binary install to custom and thus from /usr to /ur/local, no image is shown at all; can't find the nice image in the filesystem easily. Perhaps simply test for /usr/share und /usr/local/share/ and some /opt/share/ paths in this order, and then display nothing at all; or search relative to the plugin path.

Add notification messages instead of popups when removing the device was successful.

Add more translations from all over the world ;-)

To add your language, simply copy po/xfce4-mount-plugin.pot to 
po/languagecode.po and edit ALL the msgstr fields in your language with an 
UTF-8 capable editor. You can also use tools such as "msginit". 

Try to also add your name and email to the information at the beginning of the 
file.

When you've finished translating, send the gzipped PO file to 
<timystery@arcor.de> or, even better, sign up at xfce-i18n@xfce.org.

Thanks, Fabian Nowak and all other users speaking your newly translated 
language!
